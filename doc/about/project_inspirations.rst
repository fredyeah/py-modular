Inspirations behind the project
================================

This writing serves as documentation for the project roots.
It also should be taken as a place to find artistic inspiration and general resources.

.. centered:: Modular workflow inspirations

One of the biggest inspirations for py-modular has been the eurorack_ environment.
I started building eurorack_ modules a few months before I started developing this project.
The concept of large ideas being broken down into small micro-processes that are each only concerned with a simple task is very helpful,
and I think a more natural way of thinking.
It is easy to get overwhelmed with complex synthesizers, whether they be software or hardware.
It is more manageable to think only about sections of a synthesizer individually, like the oscillator, the filter, and the mixer.

In addition to the concept of eurorack_ and modular synthesis, I was heavily inspired by Max_/MSP_ and Pure_ Data_.
Both of these, for those of you who don't know, are visual programming environments for music and visuals.
I enjoy a lot using Max_/MSP_, because it helps me to break down my own creative process,
but it can be a bit tedious dragging "cables" between nodes constantly.
As someone who is far more proficient with a keyboard than a mouse, I wanted something text based instead.

Another big inspiration for me was the open source Ossia_ Score_.
Ossia_ Score_ is a sequencer/DAW that focuses on a non-linear workspace.
Using Ossia_ Score_, I realized how much more creative potential there is when you break away from a traditional timeline workflow.

.. centered:: Generative music inspiration

A large part of this project has been trying to experiment and get to know AI technologies for creative purposes.
The Magenta_ project was a large inspiration for me, as it is one of the few already well-established projects of the sort.
I think that AI has a large potential with generative music techniques, and I wanted to explore this more.
Magenta_ provides an incredible framework for working with these technologies, even for someone like myself with little experience.
I wanted to try and build on this and see how their code base could be integrated into more traditional synthesis techniques, which was the starting point for the Nsynth_ grain cloud generator.

Another inspiration for the project and the generative aspects of the project, were creations like Endel_, Dadabots_, and Jukebox_.
These are algorithms that generate entire songs, or constantly flowing music.
I think the concept of abstracting composition, and writing an algorithm instead of a score, is interesting and unexplored by most creatives.
